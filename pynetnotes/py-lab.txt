There are two components in your lab environment:
1. An AWS server
2. A set of test routers and switches that you can execute your code against.


AWS Server
AWS AMI Server (RedHat-based)
Python 2.7.12
virtualenv (so you can install Python libraries without sudo privileges)
PySNMP, Paramiko and several other libraries are already installed

You should be able to SSH into this server. I will send you your username and password in a separate email.

Note, the lab environment is using Python's virtualenv; consequently, you will need to the use the following at the top of your Python files:

#!/usr/bin/env python

This will help ensure that the correct Python is used (i.e. the virtualenv Python that has all the necessary libraries).



Lab Environment Network Devices:

The lab environment network devices consist of:
    2 x Cisco 881 routers
    4 x Arista vEOS switches
    1 x Juniper SRX

Note, the lab environment previously used port address translations. This is no longer the case. Consequently, all of the ports are now standard (SSH = TCP22, SNMP = UDP161, EAPI = TCP443).


In general, you will only be able to access the lab network devices from the lab server.
